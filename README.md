# 🌞 Solar Radiation Insights Dashboard

## 📋 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Solar Radiation Insights Dashboard**! This dashboard visualizes key insights related to solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, and other environmental factors to support solar energy investment decisions.

The goal of this project is to:
- **Analyze Solar Radiation**: Investigate solar radiation data from regions like Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
- **Identify Trends & Patterns**: Use statistical analysis to uncover trends and outliers in solar radiation data, including Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI).
- **Data Visualization**: Explore how environmental factors such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity interact with solar radiation.

## 🏆 Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in **GHI**, **DNI**, and **DHI** over time.
- Perform **outlier detection** to identify anomalies in the solar radiation data.
- Understand correlations between environmental variables like **wind speed**, **temperature**, and **humidity** with solar radiation.

### Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- A **user-friendly** and **interactive** dashboard built with Streamlit to explore data insights dynamically.
- Key features include:
  - **Correlation Heatmaps**: Visualize correlations between solar radiation and environmental factors.
  - **Time-Series Analysis**: Explore trends in GHI, DNI, DHI, and temperature over time.
  - **Wind-Solar Speed Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between wind speed and GHI.
  - **Outliers Detection**: Identify and visualize anomalies in GHI values.
